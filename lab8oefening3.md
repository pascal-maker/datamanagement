1. Sensors

Looking at Excel: OutdoorTemp, WaterTemp, pH, Hardness ‚Üí these are not columns, but different sensors.

Make a Sensor table with attributes like SensorName and Unit.

Why? Because maybe tomorrow you add ‚ÄúOxygen Level‚Äù ‚Üí you don‚Äôt want to change the schema.

Columns in Sensor:

SensorID (PK)

SensorName ("Outdoor Temp", "Water Temp", etc.)

Unit (¬∞C, pH, ¬∞dH, ‚Ä¶)

2. SensorLog

Each Excel row has measured values at a date/time.
Instead of having 4 columns for 4 sensors, we make one log row per sensor.

Columns in SensorLog:

LogID (PK)

SensorID (FK ‚Üí Sensor)

Value (the number measured)

MeasuredAt (datetime from the Excel "Date" column)

3. Actuators

From assignmentitself: Pump, UV Lamp, Aerator, Additives, Filter. These are types of actuators, so ‚Üí Actuator table.

Columns in Actuator:

ActuatorID (PK)

ActuatorName ("Pump", "UV Lamp")

Description

4. ActuatorLog

Excel rows show actions like ON/OFF, Add Additive, Drain.
So logs of what each actuator did.

Columns in ActuatorLog:

LogID (PK)

ActuatorID (FK ‚Üí Actuator)

Action ("ON", "OFF", "Additive 10ml")

ExecutedAt (timestamp





perfect üëå ‚Äî this Excel-like table is the raw logbook you‚Äôd normalize into 3NF. Let‚Äôs walk through it step by step and explain what‚Äôs going on.

üîé Columns in your file
Column	Meaning	Normalization decision
SEQUENCE NUMBER	Row ID in the log (just a running number).	Will become PK (LogID) in SensorLog.
TOPIC	What is being measured (Water Quality - Nitrite, Outdoor Temp, ‚Ä¶).	Belongs in a Sensor table.
MEASURING DEVICE	The actual device name (Nitrite Meter, Digital Temp Sensor, ‚Ä¶).	Attribute of Sensor.
DEVICEID	Short code (NO2, TEMPB, etc.).	Unique identifier in Sensor.
MEASURED VALUE	The numeric result (e.g. 10.5, 199.8, 0.1).	Goes into SensorLog.Value.
MEASUREMENT UNIT	Unit of measurement (¬∞C, ppm, mg/l, mm).	Attribute of Sensor (Unit).
MEASUREMENT DATE	When the measurement happened.	Goes into SensorLog.MeasuredAt.
DESCRIPTION	Notes (‚ÄúPreserve water quality values‚Äù).	Goes into SensorLog.Description.
‚ùå Why NOT keep it as-is?

You are repeating sensor info in every row:

"Nitrite Meter" + "NO2" + "mg/l" appears many times.

If the unit changes (say NO2 from mg/l ‚Üí ¬µg/l), you‚Äôd have to update every row.

That violates 2NF and 3NF.

‚úÖ Normalized structure (3NF)
Sensor

Static info about each device.

SensorID (PK)
Topic            (e.g. Water Quality - Nitrite)
DeviceName       (e.g. Nitrite Meter)
DeviceCode       (e.g. NO2)
Unit             (e.g. mg/l, ppm, ¬∞C)

SensorLog

Dynamic info (actual measurements).

LogID (PK)
SensorID (FK ‚Üí Sensor)
Value           (e.g. 5.0, 199.8, 10.3)
MeasuredAt      (DATETIME, from Measurement Date)
Description     (e.g. ‚ÄúPreserve water quality values‚Äù)

üßæ Example transformation

From Excel row:

Seq: 53 | Topic: Water Quality - Nitrite | Device: Nitrite Meter | ID: NO2 |
Value: 5 | Unit: mg/l | Date: 2023-02-03 12:00:00 | Desc: Preserve water quality values


Becomes two rows:

Sensor

SensorID: 2
Topic: Water Quality - Nitrite
DeviceName: Nitrite Meter
DeviceCode: NO2
Unit: mg/l


SensorLog

LogID: 53
SensorID: 2
Value: 5
MeasuredAt: 2023-02-03 12:00:00
Description: Preserve water quality values

‚úÖ Why is this 3NF?

Each table has a primary key.

No repeating groups (each sensor is one row in Sensor).

Value depends only on the Sensor + Timestamp, not on other fields.

Sensor properties (name, unit) are not repeated in logs.

üëâ So: this Excel sheet is basically a denormalized logbook.
By pulling Sensor info into one table and Log values into another, you get a clean 3NF schema.

Do you want me to also add the Actuator / ActuatorLog side to this same model (so you see the full pond automation, not just measurements)?

You said:
i und4tand but acyraors and aucturlog is not in excelf iel right
ChatGPT said:

Exactly üëç you spotted it correctly.

The Excel you showed me is only about sensors and their measurements ‚úÖ.

It logs what was measured, when, with what device.

It does not log the actuators (pumps, UV lamps, aerators, etc.).

üîë Where actuators come from

They‚Äôre mentioned in the assignment text, not in your Excel file:

‚ÄúBased on the sensor data, the system automatically manages various processes using actuators such as pumps, UV lamps, and aerators.‚Äù

That means the Excel = raw sensor data (inputs), while the assignment also expects you to model outputs (actuators + their logs).

‚úÖ So for your database in 3NF:
From Excel (sensors):

Sensor

SensorLog

From assignment (actuators):

Actuator

ActuatorLog

Optional (if you want to connect both):

ControlHistory (links a sensor reading to the actuator action triggered by it).

‚ö° So you‚Äôre right: actuators are not in the Excel, but you need to add them in your ERD because the system must also log what actions it takes in response to sensor values.
